Create connections between posts

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create many-to-many relationships between posts of all types.

To register a connection type, add this code in your theme's functions.php file:

`
function my_connection_types() {
	if ( !function_exists('p2p_register_connection_type') )
		return;

	p2p_register_connection_type( 'post', 'page' );
}
add_action('init', 'my_connection_types', 100);
`
